  <h1>Coding Exercise 22: Arrow Functions Aren't Always a Solution</h1>
  <p>Arrow functions bind the value of 'this' to the surrounding context, and sometimes this isn't the behavior we expect.  The code below has an object that represents a users profile.  The profile has a 'name' currently.  Add another key to this object called 'getName'.  'getName' should be a function that returns the profiles name, using 'this.name'.  Does the solution work with a fat arrow function or will you have to use a function keyword instead?</p>
  <p>Check the console logs!</p>

  <script>
    // Provided.
    const profile = {
      name: 'Alex'
    };

    // Solution
    const profile = {
      name: 'Alex',
      getName: function() {
        return this.name;
      }
    };

  </script>
