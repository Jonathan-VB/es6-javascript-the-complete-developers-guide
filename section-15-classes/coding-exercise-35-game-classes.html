    <h1>Coding Exercise 35: Game Classes</h1>

    <p>You are a game developer tasked with setting up some basic classes for a new game you are working on. &nbsp;Create a class called 'Monster'. &nbsp;In the constructor, you'll need to do some basic setup for Monster whenever they are created.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Initialize the Monster's health to 100.</li>
        <li>The constructor will be called with an 'options' object that has a 'name' property. &nbsp;Assign the 'name' to the Monster</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Check the console logs!</p>

    <script>
    // Provided
    class Monster {

    }

    // Solution
    class Monster {
        constructor(options) {
            this.health = 100;
            this.name = options.name;
        }
    }

    </script>
