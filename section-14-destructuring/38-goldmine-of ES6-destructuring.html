  <h1>Goldmine of ES6: Destructuring</h1>
  <p>Section 13, Lecture 38</p>
  <p>Check the console logs!</p>

  <script>
  //ES5
  var expense = {
    type: 'Business',
    amount: '$45 USD'
  };
  // var type = expense.type;
  // var amount = expense.amount;

  // ES6
  // This is not creating an object. When curly braces are used on the other side of the equals sign
  // I want to declare a new variable called 'type' and I want it to reference expense.type property.
  // same with amount.

  // So we pull a property of {this} name from an object and that property will be assigned to a variable of that same name
  const { type } = expense;
  const { amount } = expense;

  // With Destructuring, we can also combine many of these operations into a single lines
  // This makes type = expense.type = Business
  // and amount = expense.amount = $45 USD
  const { type, amount } = expense;

  // Common questions
  // Q: Does the variable name have to match up to the property name?
  // A: Yes! they must be identical.
  // So we cant do const { myType, amount } = expense;

  // Q: What happens if we reference a property that doesn't exist?
  // A: it will just return as undefined. It wont throw an error
