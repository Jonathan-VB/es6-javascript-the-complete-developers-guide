    <h1>Coding Exercise 32: Destructuring in Practice</h1>
    <p>The snippet of code below duplicates references to 'profile' inside of the 'isEngineer' function. Perhaps we can reduce the amount of code used for referencing the 'title' and 'department' properties.  Refactor this code to use destructuring. Can you get the body of the 'isEngineer' function down to a single line?</p>
    <p>Check the console logs!</p>

    <script>
    // Provided
    const profile = {
        title: 'Engineer',
        department: 'Engineering'
    };

    function isEngineer(profile) {
        var title = profile.title;
        var department = profile.department;
        return title === 'Engineer' && department === 'Engineering';
    }

    // Solution
    function isEngineer(profile) {
        const { title } = profile;
        const { department } = profile;
        return title === 'Engineer' && department === 'Engineering';
    }

    </script>
