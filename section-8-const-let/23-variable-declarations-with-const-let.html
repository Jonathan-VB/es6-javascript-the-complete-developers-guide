  <h1>Variable Declarations with Const and Let</h1>
  <p>Section 8, Lecture 23</p>
  <p>Check the console logs! Is the string correctly balanced?</p>

  <script>
  // const = Value never changes
  // let = We expect the value to change over time

  // Old way
  // var name = 'Jane';
  // var title = 'Software Engineer';
  // var hourlyWage = 40;

  // ES6
  const name = 'Jane'; // Employee's name will not change
  let title = 'Software Engineer'; // We expect that an employee may get promoted and their title will change.
  let hourlyWage = 40; // We can expect an employees wage to change over time.

  // Some time later...
  title = 'Senior Software Engineer'; // We dont need to say 'let' again as it was declared earlier
  hourlyWage = 45;
